Home for random code I write.

This is a parent repo for a bunch of smaller repos with code that used to live
here.  This is convenient because I can just checkout this repo, then run one 
command to get all of the repos with code I might use.

The child repos can be obtained by running the `create-sub-projects` command:

$ cd random_code.git/
$ ./create-sub-projects
$
